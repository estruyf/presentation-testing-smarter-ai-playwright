# The good

Ai can help us speed things up a lot!

- The test plan is well defined
- The test plan can be used as documentation
- It finds edge cases you might not think of
- It discovers anomalies

---

# The bad

AI is not perfect (yet)

- It is a slow process, but still faster than manual work
- The output is not perfect
- Watch out for throttling
- It knows your project, but not the platform
  
  *e.g., mocked APIs, were not handled correctly (GET, POST, etc.)*
